# Information Industry

致敬西奥多·阿多诺，模仿他，暂且以 **《Information Industry》** 作为标题。如若此书顺利诞生，我将会把标题改为 **《Cyberspace：A Society Comes from Information Industry》**。  
感谢帮助我的专家、学者们。他们大多都来自被学术界排挤的边缘，或者是学术界之外的人。在我眼里，他们是时代的勇者，举着微弱的火炬，在众人不顾的背影下向不确定的未来进发。无论此书经过历史的筛选，还是沦为笑柄，他们都是作者。  

编写期间，本书选择了存放于 Github 仓库，未完成部分使用 `*` 标注。请观看和**指证批评者**使用 `vscode` 打开。

Salute Theodor Wiesengrund Adorno, imitate him, and use **_Information Industry_** as the title. I will change the title to **_Cyberspace: A Society Comes from Information Industry_** if this book were bron smoothly.   
A huge thank to experts and scholars who helped me. They mainly comes from the gap of exclusion of the Academic, or out of the Academic. They are always warriors of this time in my sight, who carrying the faint torch and walk into the unknowable future with careless from mass. Whether this book were screened by the history, or just a joke, they are always authors.  

During writing and editing, this book choose storing at Github Repo, and mark the unfinished part with `*` . **Readers**, **Testifiers**, **Proposers** and **Critics** please open by `vscode`.
